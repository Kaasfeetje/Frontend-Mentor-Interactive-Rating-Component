## My process

First I got the card to be centered by having main be width:100%; height:100%; display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center; Then I tried getting the colors, since the colors from the style guide did not match up. I put the icons in seperate React elements. Then I made the Rating Button and the star icon. Then I sized the text accordingly. Finally I made the submit button.

For the thank you card, I reused most of the css for the rating card, but just centered everything and passed the rating down.
